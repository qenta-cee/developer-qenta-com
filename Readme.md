# Developer portal

## Introduction

This is the developer portal for the [ProWallet](https://prowallet.gcoin.com/). It contains all the information you need to start using the platform through the API, SDK and Tools.

## Getting started

The project is a Writerside based documentation project. It uses [Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/writerside/discover-writerside.html), a JetBrains IDE based on the IntelliJ platform. Use it to author, build, test, and publish technical documentation.

## Deploying as GitHub page

To deploy your documentation as a GitHub page, you need to find the instructions in the [Writerside tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/writerside/deploy-docs-to-github-pages.html) website.
